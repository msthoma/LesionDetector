# Lesion detector

A smartphone app built with Flutter, capable of detecting skin cancer lesions using Computer Vision. 
To do so, the app incorporates a Convolutional Neural Network trained with the 
[HAM10000 dataset](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/DBW86T), 
which consists of _"a large collection of multi-source dermatoscopic images of common pigmented skin
lesions"_.
